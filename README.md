Simple by default. Powerful when needed.
The core stays boring. Advanced features are optional and opt-in.


# Karma

Karma is an approachable toolset and language built to simplify development by focusing on clarity and developer productivity.

---

## **Introduction**

**Karma** is a streamlined, beginner-friendly language and toolkit for developers who are tired of battling their tools. Whether you're prototyping a new feature, building responsive webpages, or creating reusable UI components, Karma focuses on reducing mental load and maximizing productivity.

### Goals of Karma:
- **Reduce Mental Load**: Make development intuitive and straightforward.
- **Prioritize Readability Over Cleverness**: Code should be easy to read and maintain, even for beginners.
- **Remove Repetition and Noise**: Develop pages and components without unnecessary boilerplate.
- **Put Users First**: Focus on solving real developer frustrations, not chasing trendy features.
- **Stay Beginner-Friendly**: Never punish beginners or overcomplicate the development process.

That’s it. No code. No extra polish. Just tools that work for you, not against you.
