# Karma

Karma is built for people who are tired of fighting their tools.

- **Karma exists to**: reduce mental load when building pages
- **Karma prioritizes**: readability over cleverness
- **Karma helps users by**: removing repetition and noise
- **Karma listens by**: documenting real user pain, not feature demands
- **Karma will never**: punish beginners or chase hype.

That’s it. No code. No polish.
